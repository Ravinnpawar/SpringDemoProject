/*
AOP--
* Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns.
aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, caching, etc.
cross cutting concerns
*  The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting
*  concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic.
The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect.
Dependency Injection helps you decouple your application objects from each other and AOP helps you decouple cross-cutting
concerns from the objects that they affect.

Sr.No	Terms & Description
1	 Aspect           This is a module which has a set of APIs providing cross-cutting requirements. For example, a
 logging module would be called AOP aspect for logging. An application can have any number of aspects depending on the requirement.

2	Join point      This represents a point in your application where you can plug-in the AOP aspect.
You can also say, it is the actual place in the application where an action will be taken using Spring AOP framework.

3
Advice

This is the actual action to be taken either before or after the method execution.
This is an actual piece of code that is invoked during the program execution by Spring AOP framework.

4
Pointcut

This is a set of one or more join points where an advice should be executed.
 You can specify pointcuts using expressions or patterns as we will see in our AOP examples.

5
Introduction

An introduction allows you to add new methods or attributes to the existing classes.

6
Target object

The object being advised by one or more aspects. This object will always be a proxied object,
also referred to as the advised object.

7
Weaving

Weaving is the process of linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object.
 This can be done at compile time, load time, or at runtime.

Types of Advice
Spring aspects can work with five kinds of advice mentioned as follows âˆ’

Sr.No	Advice & Description
1
before

Run advice before the a method execution.

2
after

Run advice after the method execution, regardless of its outcome.

3
after-returning

Run advice after the a method execution only if method completes successfully.

4
after-throwing

Run advice after the a method execution only if method exits by throwing an exception.

5
around

Run advice before and after the advised method is invoked.
